But genuinely did not use any AI. It was a visual media piece but I copied every piece of text into every single AI checker I could find after receiving the 0 and nothing even detected any % of Ai. Same with the post I just did an received a 0. It\u2019s only 2.5% of my grade per post but I feel like it\u2019s insane, I\u2019ve never been accused of using AI before I don\u2019t get what their process is for flagging things? Wasn\u2019t even told anything besides for ai is not permitted alongside a 0.",
