I don\u2019t have a medical reason to show or anything like that, and it was so long ago already. I am doing well in the course otherwise, but the syllabus makes it sound like taking each quiz is mandatory in order to pass (60%, pass or fail course).. \n\n*Update: I later emailed the prof about this and she said the quiz could be made up by doing an extra credit assignment. I completed that assignment and should have a high enough grade to pass this course. The course is done now, however, my unofficial final grade transcript has it listed as \u201cU\u201d (meaning unsatisfactory.) I know it isn\u2019t official, but I can\u2019t really see why it would change later on? It\u2019s a required course for my major, so I guess I\u2019ll need to retake it in the spring if possible. ",

I prefer tests/quizzes/exams over essays way more so I don\u2019t wanna take anything with any / minimal essays.\n\n\nEDIT: I just realized UU150 is pass or fail and doesn\u2019t count towards GPA\n\nSo my question now I guess is, is it worth putting (presumably) more effort into AR101 and getting a grade? Or just having practically a free course and I can focus on my other courses more?\n\n\nALSO if anyone has the syllabus for either that would be very helpful!!!!!",

I don't want to seem lazy but my fall term has alot of pretty hard classes, and I have a big remote internship, so  I just need one easy elective to lessen my stress. I have taken u101, uu150, dh100 and em203. The first 3 were the easiest thing ever. Em203 had alot of writing which I didn't like but no midterm or final so that won it over for me.\n\nPlease recommend any 2nd or 1st year courses for me please with a little note on how much work load it is. Thank you!!  \n",

      "selftext": "I have decided to write this guide for current first year students in the Bachelor of Business Administration program to clear misconceptions, and summarize the co-op admissions process.\n\n*(Disclaimer: I do not work for the co-op office, nor can I guarantee that all the information enclosed is 100% correct, and is mostly based on information put out by the co-op office, and partly based on my anecdotal experience applying for (and getting into) coop this year.)*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Step 1: Applying to the Coop Program on Navigator**\n\nThis is the easiest part of the whole process. Applications typically open up in March of your first year, in the Winter semester. All that is required at this point is to go to navigator.wlu.ca and go to the \u201cCoop\u201d tab and click \u201cApply\u201d. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve done that, you have successfully begun the application process. The deadline to do this step extends until early September each year, but that is for specific reasons that I will elaborate on later in this document. Generally, you want to apply as early as possible so that your application is in the queue and you can schedule your admissions interview.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Step 2: Meeting the Minimum GPA for an Interview**\n\nIn August of your first year summer, if you had applied on Navigator already, you will be contacted via email to let you know if you met the minimum GPA for an interview. \n\nEach year, based on the GPAs achieved of the first year BBA class, the co-op office will select a minimum GPA requirement to be eligible for an interview. I will provide some historical data on GPA minimums and the average GPA of a student admitted to coop in past years:\n\n* 2019 Coop Minimum | Average GPA: \n * 8.8 | 10.3\n* 2020 Coop Minimum | Average GPA:\n * 9.0 | 10.1\n* 2021 Coop Minimum | Average GPA:\n * 9.1 | 10.6\n* 2022 Coop Minimum | Average GPA:\n * 9.0 | To Be Determined\u2026\n\nAs you can see, the minimum GPA typically hovers around a 9 / 12, and the average GPA is around a low to mid 10 / 12. But, do not be discouraged if your GPA is not above the average GPA. The coop office admits students with a range of GPAs from just past the minimum all the way near to perfect 12s. The key point here is that you have to reach the minimum (9+ GPA) and generally aim as high as possible while enhancing your work and volunteer / extracurricular experiences.\n\nThere are a bunch of formalities in regards to courses you can take and how they assess your academic performance. I encourage you to read through all the regulations [here] \n(https://students.wlu.ca/work-leadership-and-volunteering/co-op/assets/resources/grade-requirements/business-and-economics-grade-requirements.html), but I will summarize a few key GPA related mistakes I have seen:\n\n* You should **strongly intend** to complete five full credit courses (ten half-credit courses) by April of your first year.\n * This means taking 5 courses in the Fall term, and 5 courses in the Winter term, and not failing any of them, plus meeting progression.\n * If you end up having to repeat a course, you will need to do it during the Spring term after your Winter term, and this will delay your eligibility for co-op as well as give you less credit for your academic achievement compared to those who completed all of their courses in one attempt in Fall and Winter.\n* Do not take additional elective courses in the Spring term thinking it will \u201cboost\u201d your average\n * The coop office only looks at your **first** 5.0 credits (10 half-credit courses), meaning for your typical BBA student it would look like:\n     * **Fall Term:**\n          * BU111\n          * EC120\n          * (BU127 or MA129)\n          * Elective\n          * Elective\n     * **Winter Term:**\n          * BU121\n          * EC140\n          * (BU127 or MA129)\n          * Elective\n          * Elective\n    * If you followed this course schedule, you would have fulfilled your 5.0 credits and any additional elective courses taken would **NOT** count towards your coop GPA, unless you **repeat** a course or a course **required** for progression to second year.\n* Do not take courses that display marks as Satisfactory / Unsatisfactory (ex: UU150)\n  * When calculating your GPA, the co-op office will include only those courses for which they see a numeric grade, and they will exclude grades from courses such as UU150 that provide only a grade of either satisfactory or unsatisfactory.\n  * They will, however, include courses graded as \"satisfactory\" when counting the number of courses you have completed.\n  * But, they may give you slightly less credit for your marks than they give students who provided numeric grades for all ten half-credits.\n     * **Side note:** If you have heard about \u201cCrediting\u201d or \u201cCRing\u201d a course, don\u2019t feel worried. This was a policy that was put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic that allowed students to replace a 0.5 credit per term (they passed) with a \u201cCR\u201d instead of a letter grade on their transcript. This was intended to let students progress with their programs even if they had struggled during the pandemic in a course. However, this policy is not in place any more due to the return to in-person learning. Last year, it was an option to boost your GPA but also resulted in your GPA being seen as a bit lesser than someone without any credits.\n\nAgain, these are just some common trends I noticed in regards to the GPA requirement, but this list is not exhaustive and I highly recommend looking at the link above that encompasses all the regulations. Now we can move onto the next step, which is your coop admission interview.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Step 3: Preparing For and Conducting Your Coop Interview**\n\nYou\u2019ve successfully applied on Navigator, and met the minimum GPA for an interview, now what? Well, in the email previously mentioned you would get in August, there will also be a link to schedule an interview. I would highly recommend scheduling an interview ~~as soon as you receive the email, because time slots fill up quickly and you want to do it on a day you are available and prepared for it.~~ (Edit: Now that I think about it, you could wait a bit and see how the questions are from friends who did their interview, but that's up to you. I prefer getting it out of the way, and the questions will be similar to the \"sample\" ones below.) \n\nNow that you\u2019ve scheduled the interview, what do you need to prepare, and what are they evaluating?\n\nBefore your scheduled interview, you will need to upload an introductory statement, form and resume at LEAST **four business days** in advance. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Introductory Statement + Sequence Form:**\n\nThe introductory statement and form is just an online Qualtrics form where you write in your work experience over the past three years, including the dates worked, hours worked and names of supervisors for references, etc. You will also have to indicate your coop sequence preference. I won\u2019t go into too much detail on the coop sequences, and I **STRONGLY** encourage you to read about them [here](https://students.wlu.ca/work-leadership-and-volunteering/co-op/assets/resources/bba-sequence-options.html) before making a choice on the form, as you cannot change your sequence (unless under special circumstances with accounting firms). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Resume:**\n\nOn that same form, you will upload your resume. You need to follow the sample resume template found [here](https://students.wlu.ca/work-leadership-and-volunteering/co-op/assets/resources/resume-examples.html#examples). However, the co-op office **ONLY** considers what is said by you **DURING** the interview, and the resume is for reference only. So, if you do not talk about an experience during the interview, even if it is on your resume, it won\u2019t be considered. But, you still need to submit the resume, and it is extremely helpful to have on hand when conducting your interview, so I will provide some tips on the coop resume (based on my experience and friends):\n\n* It can only be **two** pages maximum, and you should aim to make it two pages if you have the experience\n* Focus on Employment skills that would be attractive to coop employers\n  * The employment skills section on the sample resume is pretty bad in my opinion, and for your resume, you should focus on things that make you stand out from the crowd, while being appropriate for a potential coop employer to look at.\n* Focus on impact and results in your Work Experience section\n * Instead of just writing something like:\n     * *\u201cWorked at a grocery store as a cashier, and served customers\u201d*\n * Change it to focus on impact achieved, such as:\n     * *\u201cWorked in a senior cashier position in a multinational grocery chain, transacting 100+ customers on a daily basis, resolving an average of 5 customer complaints a day, resulting in a designation of \u201cEmployee of the Month\u201d for providing exceptional customer service in my role.\u201d*\n* Ensure you contact your past employers to ensure they can verify your employment, in case the coop office decides to reach out\n  * I do not believe that they reach out to many employers, but I would advise you to reach out to current and former employers to make sure they are willing to verify your work there, because this can cause problems if they are unaware.\n* Combine \u201cVolunteering\u201d and \u201cExtracurricular Activities\u201d into one section\n  * I personally did not have much actual \u201cvolunteer\u201d experience (like volunteering in a soup kitchen or homeless shelter), but I had a lot of extracurricular activities. The coop office confirmed that you can combine the two sections, and I would recommend doing so if possible unless you have extensive \u201cvolunteer\u201d experience.\n * In this section you should highlight 3-4 important activities, with activities from university being at the top, and high school activities towards the bottom of this list. You want to include any \u201cexecutive\u201d type roles held here, like being a Vice President or Director of a club here. \u201cGeneral Member\u201d type roles can go at the bottom under \u201cAdditional Activities\u201d of the resume just as bullet points, with no descriptions.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Interview Itself:**\n\nThey evaluate you on 4 parts, all weighted equally (25% each):\n\n* Academic record in your first year at Laurier (GPA)\n* Paid work experience in the last three years\n* Volunteer service and extracurricular activities in the last three years\n* Performance during the interview\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI will go into more detail, and give tips and advice on each part:\n\n\n* **Academic Record**\n * This relates to what I have mentioned earlier, where they look at your first year GPA and can give more or less weight based on your circumstances. People tend to overestimate the importance of this factor, as it is only 1/4 of your overall application. But, generally you should aim to have as high of a GPA as possible, take all your required and elective courses in Fall / Winter, and not fail or have to repeat any courses.\n * Even if you do fail a course, or have to repeat a course do not worry. There have been students in the past who have failed or had to repeat a course (or two) to up their GPA, and have successfully gotten accepted into the coop program. However, you want to aim to not be in this position if possible.\n* **Work Experience**\n * They look at your last three years of **PAID** work experience. For most students this will be Grade 11, Grade 12, and First Year. If you took a gap year, it would be Grade 12, Gap Year, and First Year.\n * The coop office stresses the importance of **PAID** work experience, even if it is not in a directly business related role, from high school, for example. Unpaid internships (ex: search funds), do not count for this section as they were not paid at least minimum wage. The co-op office will confirm that each experience is paid during the interview.\n     * If you do not have much work experience coming into university, don\u2019t fret. You can try to work part time during the school year, but I can understand how that may not be the most ideal situation for a lot of students. \n * Every prospective co-op applicant should focus on getting an **office job** in the First Year summer. This is taken directly from the coop FAQ:\n     * *\u201cThe admission process is very competitive, as we interview many more students than we can admit to co-op. We assess both the quality and the quantity of work experience. If you have related experience in an office or in a supervisory role, you may have an advantage, as long as you are able to tell us about your role effectively during the interview. Try to build on the work experience you have obtained already, and search for relevant work experience during your first year or during the following summer. Even if you don't have relevant jobs, please tell us about your roles, responsibilities and how you gained skills.*\n         * To obtain this type of work experience, you need to lean on personal connections, familial connections and smaller businesses. If this is not possible, look for supervisory roles and APPLY APPLY APPLY. I will probably make a first year summer job application guide soon.\n* **Volunteering / Extracurricular Activities**\n * In this section, you should focus again on impact and your role on any organization. The coop FAQ states:\n     * *\u201cYou should be able to list all the roles you held during senior high school and university. If you did more than attend meetings, explain how you contributed to each organization.\u201d*\n * Generally, I have seen most successful applicants have 1 or 2 executive positions in clubs at Laurier and outside of the university, as these positions are valued much higher than general membership positions. But, you should also make sure not to overburden yourself and see your GPA slip, as if you don\u2019t meet the minimum requirements, you won\u2019t be eligible for an interview regardless of your extracurricular achievements.\n * You will also have to list your awards and achievements. This can include things like case competitions, stock pitch competitions, scholarship wins / nominations, job-related awards, etc. For this section, it is helpful to have a short description of why you won the award and be able to explain the impact to the interviewers.\n* **Interview Performance**\n * This is an underrated part of your application to coop. Many students underestimate the importance of having good interview skills, and think that their GPA and experiences will carry them through the process. You need to prepare well for your interview, and I will list some tips below:\n     * Remember that if it is not said in the interview, it doesn\u2019t exist\n         * As previously mentioned, your resume is more or less a formality in the process, so you need to be able to communicate your experiences and accomplishments well in the interview itself, as that is what they\u2019ll be going off of.\n         * I (and the coop office) strongly recommend following the S.T.A.R.R interview question answer format, which is:\n             * Situation: Define the general context.\n             * Task: Identify the key objective.\n             * Action: Describe the action you took or initiated, emphasizing the skills you used to complete the task.\n             * Results: Summarize the outcome in business terms.\n             * Relevance: Bring your experience back to how this will be relevant to a potential coop employer.\n * Do NOT pre-write answers to questions, but practice your answers to the following sample questions:\n     * Tell us about your employment in the last three years, including your roles and contributions.\n      * Tell us about your volunteer and extracurricular activities in your first year at university.\n     * Tell us about your volunteer and extracurricular activities in the previous two years.\n      * Tell us about a time when you solved a problem.\n     * Tell us about two or three of your greatest accomplishments. \n     * Tell us if the global pandemic caused any gaps in your work, volunteer or extracurricular activities and tell us about anything you accomplished during the gaps.\n\n * Do not refer to BBA core competitions (ex: Live Case, New Venture, Pitch Competition, etc.) when talking about experiences or achievements\n     * The interviewers know you are in the BBA program and participate in the mandatory competitions for the first year. These are common across all applicants and do not make you stand out or emphasize your unique skills and abilities. Strongly avoid talking about these in your interview, unless you were a top placer or finalist, and even then, only mention it only if necessary.\n  * Arrive early, and ensure your tech setup is solid\n     * The interviews are conducted virtually over Microsoft Teams, so make sure you are set up well ahead of the scheduled time and be aware they may start late\n   * Be aware of your time during the interview\n     * The allotted time during the interview is 15 minutes. \n     * You generally want to stick to that time frame, but it is okay if you go over a bit. You do not want to be talking in long, run-on sentences, as this will harm your performance in this category.\n   * Dress professionally and maintain a positive attitude\n     * I would recommend business formal attire, like a dress shirt and tie for example\n     * Smile, and give off positive vibes. The interviewers know that the interview can be stressful, but smiling helps to make everyone feel more comfortable and relaxed\n     * Once it\u2019s all over, you will feel a weight lifted off your shoulders and know that it is out of your hands. Remember, everything will be okay!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much all I have to say about the co-op admissions process. If you follow these steps, you should be in good shape to get admitted. I hope this clears up some of the questions you had, and upper years, feel free to give any advice you may have in the comments section below. I will also try to answer questions as I see them. \n\nHopefully this was useful to you, and remember to not stress too much about coop. Now, having gotten my coop acceptance, I realized a lot of the stress I had last year was unwarranted. You can be successful with or without coop, and it is simply a tool that can help guide your job search process. \n\nBest of luck first years, and remember *\u201cStress acts as an accelerator: it will push you either forward or backward, but you choose which direction.\u201d - Chelsea Erieau*",
