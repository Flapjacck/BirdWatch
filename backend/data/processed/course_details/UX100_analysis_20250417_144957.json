      "selftext": "I'm just about to complete my first year in BBA and don't know if it's worth staying in for the next 3 years. As a confused high school student not knowing what to pursue, I chose to do business administration because of the versatility that a business degree holds and the different paths you can take, despite not knowing what exactly I wanted to do in business. But I just haven't really enjoyed first year all that much. The courses that we've taken have not been enjoyable for me, although I don't imagine the majority of students did. I don't like accounting, economics and I don't see myself working a job in finance, which doesn't leave too many pathways for me to pursue. I've done some marketing, primarily for a LazSoc club that I'm in, and I see that to be the only thing out of business I can see myself doing, but still something I'm unsure about--don't think it's something I would want to pursue for the rest of my life. \n\nI've been told that the program starts to pick up in later years, when you can start to specialize in 3rd year and actually choose the courses you take. But in my mind, I feel like I'm definitely taking a gamble now that I've cut down a bunch of the options available for me in business. In 2nd year, I still have to take econ, accounting and finance, so I'm afraid it might be a repeat of year 1. \n\nI do understand that the first 2 years are structured in order to weed people out or just teach courses that are intro/general business courses, everyone knows this. But I can't help and think that I may end up regretting choosing this program as the years go by.   \n   \nIn terms of grades, I am making the cutoff to apply for Co-op, although nothing too out of this world---just fairly content with how I'm doing (electives carried last sem, with BU111, EC120 and MA129 ranging around 8-9)\n\nSome paths I've been considering are UX, CS, SoftEng. Law is also something I enjoyed in high school, and always kept as kind of a backup after my undergrad. I am interested in working in Tech, and pursuing something that allows me to design and be creative, and hone rewarding job prospects--albeit the fact that the above job titles are a lot more than just that and require foundations in other areas such as math. As a matter of fact, math is one of the things that does hold me back from pursuing CS (not the best at Calc lol). I took CP104 and UX100 (both OC) in the summer to help me get a foot into both fields and see if it's something I really want to do, but if I want to switch programs (open to switching universities, which might be a bit late), I do not want to prolong my decision-making. \n\nI think that staying in BBA would still be an asset, due to it just being a remarkable program that can help land a number of jobs, but I want to spend the following years doing something I enjoy and is rewarding. I've booked an appointment with BBA academic advising next week so I'll see how that goes\n\nThis post might have been a lil too long, so thank you if you have read up til this far. I'm stuck in a rut and I would really appreciate any insightful advice in helping me decide what I can do.  \n\n(Also if anybody is able to speak on the UX program or the UX minor, please let me know what your experience has been like as there seems to be a minority of you.)",
